            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi Ghouls, my name is Anna Molly. I'm a full time Horror nerd and I run my FB group "Macedonian Horror
              Community" and the same page there as well. I've been on radio shows to talk
              about my group and Horror movies and also organise movie nights with everyone who is a true lover of " The
              Terror". Everyone is welcomed.
              Horror movies are my passion. My first Horror movie is "Evil Dead 2" at the age of 6. Since then, I fell in
              love with Horror movies and all the creepy stuff out there.
              I can watch up to 10 movies in a row ( my record is 8) and sleep well after that ( 'Ha, Ha'*laughs like a
              maniac).
              My favorite genre is "Survival Horror" and my favorite Horror movie is "The Descent" from Neil Marshall.
              But as you can see I have a quite little obsession with Freddy Krueger. That obvious ha. Fell in love with his
              funny character from early age.
              So, I hope you like my page and maybe someday we're gonna watch a Horror movie on a cold night, near Pet
              Cemeteries Michael Myers and Jason.

                  <span>Frederick Charles "Freddy" Krueger (/ˈkruːɡər/) is a character from the A Nightmare on Elm Street
                    film series.
                    He first appeared in Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) as a burnt serial killer who uses a
                    gloved hand with razors to kill his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as
                    well.
                    In the dream world, he is a powerful force and almost completely invulnerable. However, whenever Freddy
                    is pulled into the real world, he has normal human vulnerabilities.
                    The character was created by Wes Craven and was consistently portrayed by Robert Englund in the original
                    film series as well as in the television spin-off.

                    Created by Victor Miller, with contributions by Ron Kurz, Sean S. Cunningham and Tom Savini, Jason was not originally intended to carry the series as the main antagonist.</span>

                </div>
                  <span>Michael Myers is a fictional character from the Halloween series of slasher films. He first appears in John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) as a young boy who murders his sister, Judith Myers, and then, fifteen years later, returns home to Haddonfield to murder more teenagers.
                      Michael Myers is characterized as pure evil, both directly in the films, by the filmmakers who created and developed the character over nine films, as well as by random participants in a survey.[1][2] The mask Michael Myers wears is a Captain Kirk mask which was painted white.
